# **Mini-JVM**

Welcome to **Mini-JVM**, a lightweight, educational implementation of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This project aims to simulate the core components of a JVM, providing insights into how Java bytecode is executed.

## **Features**
- **Class Loading**: Simulates the loading of Java `.class` files.
- **Bytecode Execution**: Implements a simple bytecode execution engine.
- **Memory Management**: Manages class data, including the method area, heap, and stack.
- **Instruction Set**: Supports a limited set of JVM instructions for demonstration purposes.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core language for implementing JVM components.
- **File I/O**: For reading and parsing `.class` files.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Follows OOP principles to ensure modular and scalable code.

## **Why Mini-JVM?**
The purpose of **Mini-JVM** is to provide a **simplified** and **educational** approach to understanding the inner workings of the Java Virtual Machine. Whether you are learning about the JVM or just curious about how Java bytecode is executed, this project offers a hands-on experience in **low-level programming** and **virtual machine design**.
